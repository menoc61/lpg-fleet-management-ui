# 05 — API Endpoints (REST + WebSocket)

Base path: `/api/v1`. Every response follows the envelope: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: any, pagination?: { page, limit, total }, filters?: {...} }`. All inputs validated with Zod. Every write endpoint must write to `audit_logs`.

> Grounded against the live SQL schema — endpoints referencing columns/tables that don't exist yet (e.g. `client_sites.client_id`, `redressements.currency`, `scan_events.tour_id`) are marked with ⚠️ and the actual join path to use instead.

## Prometheus Metrics (exposed at `GET /system/metrics`)

`gpl_api_requests_total`, `gpl_api_request_duration_seconds`, `gpl_active_pdas`, `gpl_active_tours{execution_mode}`, `gpl_scan_events_total{direction,type}`, `gpl_anomalies_total{category,type,severity}`, `gpl_device_offline_total{device_type}`, `gpl_reconciliation_gap{marketeur_org_id}`, `gpl_risk_score{entity_type,entity_id}`, `gpl_db_connection_pool`, `gpl_kafka_consumer_lag{topic,partition}`.

## MinIO Buckets

`csph-certificates` (vehicle certificates), `csph-proofs` (delivery/pickup proof photos), `csph-reports` (generated reports), `csph-documents` (general docs), `csph-firmware` (PDA/GPS firmware). All uploads produce pre-signed download URLs; retention matches `settings.audit.retention_years` for evidentiary buckets.
