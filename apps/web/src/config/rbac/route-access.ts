/**
 * Route-level permission gate.
 *
 * Single source of truth: `NAV_CATALOG` in `./nav-items`. Every nav item
 * declares the feature path it grants access to (via `resolveFeaturePath`)
 * and the permission codes required to view it. The sidebar uses the same
 * catalog for *visibility*; this module reuses it for *enforcement*, so the
 * two can never drift apart.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   1. A role's own landing path is always allowed (AGENTS.md §5). Without
 *      this rule a landing like TRANSPORTEUR → `/transporters` would loop,
 *      because the `transporters` nav item requires `transporters.read`,
 *      which TRANSPORTEUR does not hold.
 *   2. Chrome-reachable pages (user menu, landing, header) are open to every
 *      authenticated role, even when a nav item also declares their path.
 *      The `settings` nav item (requires `settings.read`, SUPERADMIN-only)
 *      and the per-role `/settings` hub share a path: the sidebar gates the
 *      *entry's visibility*; the route stays open. (Catalog collision to
 *      reconcile in plan Milestone 0.)
 *   3. Any other path declared by a nav item is allowed only if the role
 *      holds at least one of its required codes.
 *   4. Paths with no nav declaration (e.g. `/tour-tracking` before the catalog refresh,
 *      `/dashboard`) are reachable only via app chrome (header, landing) and
 *      are left open — declare a nav item to start gating one.
