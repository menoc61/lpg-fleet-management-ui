/**
 * Role → sidebar routing.
 *
 * The actual sidebar content is permission-driven: see `./nav-items.ts`.
 * This file only exposes:
 *
 *   • `LANDING_BY_ROLE` — the bare feature path each role lands on after
 *     login (single source of truth; used by `routes/_authenticated/index.tsx`
 *     and the route-access guard).
 *   • `getSidebarData(role)` — delegates to `buildSidebarFor(role)`.
 *
 * Per AGENTS.md §5 there are **no role-prefixed URLs**: every nav item points
 * at a bare feature path (`/trucks`, `/marketers`, …) regardless of the
 * active role. The role only governs *which* items are visible, never the
 * URL shape. Link labels, icons, and permission codes live in `nav-items.ts`.
