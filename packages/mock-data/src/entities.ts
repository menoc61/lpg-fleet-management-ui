/**
 * Typed accessors for the curated fixture collection.
 *
 * `curated` from `@lpg/mock-data` indexes every entity by its schema name
 * (`regions`, `organizations`, `users`, …) with the right shape from
 * `@lpg/types`. This module re-exports the individual collections with
 * concrete element types so feature files never need `as any` casts.
 *
 * Schema entities that don't yet exist in the seed JSON (e.g. settings,
 * audit_logs, reports, rfid_tags, custom_roles) are NOT re-exported here.
 * Feature code consuming them must derive values programmatically — the
 * curated source of truth does not pretend to ship data it doesn't have.
